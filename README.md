## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Ollama with your preferred language model
- 8GB RAM minimum
- 20GB disk space
- Additional system dependencies (managed by Docker):
  - poppler-utils (for PDF processing)
  - tesseract-ocr and libtesseract-dev (for text extraction)
  - antiword and unrtf (for DOC/DOCX/RTF processing)

### Installing Ollama

1. Install Ollama:
   - Linux: `curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`
   - macOS/Windows: Download from https://ollama.ai

2. Pull the language model (deepseek-r1:14b is the default, but you can use any Ollama model by updating the .env file):
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b  # or your preferred model
```

## Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone and setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatteoAdamo82/doc-analyzer
cd doc-analyzer
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure `.env`:
```env
OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal  # Use 'localhost' for local dev
OLLAMA_PORT=11434
CHROMA_DB_PATH=/app/data/chroma
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-r1:14b  # Default model (used as fallback if selected model is unavailable)
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200
PERSIST_VECTORDB=false
```

3. Running the application:
```bash
# Start the web application
docker compose up -d

# Access the web interface at http://localhost:8000
```

4. Running tests:
```bash
# Run the test suite
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Supported File Types

Doc Analyzer supports a wide range of file formats:

### Document Files
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Microsoft Word (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- Rich Text Format (`.rtf`)
- Plain Text (`.txt`)
- Markdown (`.md`)

### Tabular Data Files
- Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)
- CSV (`.csv`)
- OpenDocument Spreadsheet (`.ods`)
- JSON (`.json`) - structured as tabular data

### Configuration Files
- YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`)

### Code Files
- Python (`.py`)
- JavaScript (`.js`)
- TypeScript (`.ts`)
- Java (`.java`)
- C/C++ (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`)

- CSS (`.css`)
- Many others...

### Special Files
- **Dockerfiles**: Due to Gradio UI limitations, Dockerfiles (which have no extension) must be renamed with an extension (e.g., `Dockerfile.txt`) before uploading. The system will automatically detect Dockerfile content based on common instructions.

## Tabular Data Processing

Doc Analyzer provides robust capabilities for tabular data processing:

### Features
- **Streamlined conversion**: Automatically converts various tabular formats into text for optimal analysis
- **Multi-format support**: Handles CSV, Excel, ODS, and structured JSON
- **Multi-sheet processing**: Processes all sheets in Excel and ODS documents
- **Natural analysis**: Preserves the original data format to facilitate querying

### Analysis Capabilities
The tabular data processor enhances the ability to query:
- Tabular data in various formats
- Complex spreadsheets with multiple sheets
- CSV files with non-standard formatting

### Tips for Using Tabular Data
- For CSV files with non-standard formatting, the system attempts to detect delimiters automatically
- When asking questions about tabular data, specify column names for more precise answers
- Statistical queries (averages, maxima, trends) are particularly effective with tabular data
- For Excel files with multiple sheets, you can reference specific sheets in your queries  

## Usage Guide

1. **Upload And Process Documents**
   - Click upload area or drag-and-drop your document
   - Supported formats include PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, code files, and more
   - For Dockerfiles, rename the file with an extension (e.g., Dockerfile.txt) before uploading
   - Click "Add to Context" button to add the document to the current context
   - You can add multiple documents to the context one by one
   - Each document added will be shown in the Context Status area
   - The documents are processed automatically when added

2. **Managing Document Context**
   - All uploaded documents are accumulated in the context
   - Each document's content is indexed and made available for querying
   - You can view the current context in the "Context Status" area
   - To remove a specific document, select it from the dropdown and click "Remove Selected File"
   - To remove all documents, click the "Clear Context" button
   - Clearing the context resets the vector database completely

3. **Ask Questions**
   - Type your question in the text input
   - Select an analysis role from the dropdown:
     - General document analysis with comprehensive and objective information
     - Legal: Legal implications, regulatory requirements, and potential legal risks
     - Financial: Financial analysis, costs, benefits, ROI, and economic considerations
     - Travel: Objective analysis of travel information, logistics, attractions, and practical advice
     - Travel Agent: Conversational travel recommendations with a warm, personal tone (emulates a real travel agent)
     - Technical: Technical details, implementation specifics, and architectural considerations
   - Select an LLM model from the dropdown (models are automatically populated from Ollama)
   - Click "Send" or press Enter
   - Receive role-specific AI-generated responses based on all documents in context

4. **Multi-Document Analysis**
   - The system automatically retrieves information from all added documents
   - You can ask questions that require information from multiple documents
   - The AI will combine relevant information from different documents to provide comprehensive answers
   - The more specific your question, the more targeted the response will be

5. **Model Selection**
   - All models available in your Ollama installation are displayed in the dropdown
   - The default model from your `.env` file is preselected
   - The system will fall back to the default model if the selected model is unavailable
   - Different models may be better suited for different types of documents or questions

## Best Practices

- Add related documents to the context for comprehensive analysis
- Use clear, specific questions
- Ask one question at a time
- For complex multi-document scenarios, start with general questions
- Wait for each response before asking the next question
- If you're starting a new topic, consider clearing the context first
- When uploading Dockerfiles, rename them with a `.txt` extension
- For code files with uncommon extensions, consider renaming to a common extension

## Architecture

The application consists of several components:

### Web Interface (FastAPI + Gradio)
- Handles file uploads and user interactions
- Provides intuitive interface
- Manages user sessions

### Document Processors
- PDF Processor:
  - Extracts text from PDF documents using PyMuPDF
  - Splits content into manageable chunks
- Word Processor:
  - Processes DOC files using antiword
  - Handles DOCX files using python-docx
- Text Processor:
  - Processes plain text files
- RTF Processor:
  - Processes Rich Text Format files using textract
- Code Processor:
  - Handles various programming languages and code files
  - Provides language-specific metadata
  - Identifies Dockerfiles based on content patterns

### RAG Processor
- Creates embeddings using various language models via Ollama
- Stores vectors in ChromaDB
- Retrieves relevant content for queries
- Generates responses using selectable AI models
- Supports model selection directly from the interface
- Automatically uses available Ollama models

### Vector Store (ChromaDB)
- Stores document embeddings from multiple documents
- Enables semantic search across all documents
- Maintains document-query relevance

## Troubleshooting

### Dockerfiles Not Being Recognized
- Rename your Dockerfile to include an extension (e.g., Dockerfile.txt)
- Ensure the Dockerfile contains standard Docker instructions
- The system requires at least 2 common Dockerfile instructions to automatically detect it

### Database Issues
If you get "readonly database" error in local development:
```bash
chmod -R 777 ./data
rm -rf ./data/chroma/*
```

### Ollama Connection
1. Verify Ollama is running: `ollama list`
2. Check service: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
3. Check `.env` configuration matches your setup
4. For Docker Desktop users, ensure `host.docker.internal` is used

### Document Processing Issues
- PDF files: Ensure the PDF is not password-protected
- DOC files: File must be readable by antiword
- DOCX files: File must be a valid Office Open XML format
- RTF files: Must be standard RTF format readable by textract
- If text extraction fails, try converting the document to PDF or TXT
- If adding a document doesn't update the context, try clearing the context and adding it again
